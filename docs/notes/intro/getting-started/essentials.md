# Preparing the Essentials

Now that you have Node succesfully installed, it is up to you to choose which IDE/Text Editor you wish to use. A personal recommendation would be [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) due to how lightweight it is in comparison to its [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) counterpart. However, there are numerous IDEs out there for you to select from, just pick whichever you think you'll be the most comfortable with!

Whilst you're installing or selecting the IDE you wish to work with, it is highly suggested that you sign up to some form of online version control service, like [GitHub](). Version control is something which will be covered in these notes at a later stage, but it is important to have set up going forward – you will find it incredibly useful once you get used to the CLI.

::: tip
Don't get `git` and `GitHub` confused, they are two different things – although GitHub does rely upon the `git` software, it is not the same thing.
