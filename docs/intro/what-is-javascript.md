# What is JavaScript?

[JavaScript](https://javascript.info) was initially created to serve and fulfill a single purpose – to make webpages feel _alive_ – of course, that goal was achieved and now we're using it for much different things.

Usually programs written in JavaScript are referred to as `scripts`, they live inside of the HTML's DOM and often run client-side when the page has been loaded. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

::: tip Note:
Knowing the [differences](https://www.javatpoint.com/compiler-vs-interpreter) between `compiled` and `interpreted` languages is important.

JavaScript itself is rather flexible and forgiving as a language. It is one of the most [weakly-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing) languages out there. However, that is not to say that it is a _bad_ language, or any way inferior to other languages. Some of it's main strengths come from the way it is so weakly-typed and versatile – for this reason developers have written a [variety](https://www.npmjs.com/) of tools built on top of the core JavaScript language, these include:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Libraries](https://kinsta.com/blog/javascript-libraries/)
- [APIs](https://www.creativebloq.com/features/best-javascript-apis)
- And many, many more...
